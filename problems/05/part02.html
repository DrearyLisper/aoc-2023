<article class="day-desc"><p>Everyone will starve if you only plant such a small number of seeds. Re-reading the almanac, it looks like the <code>seeds:</code> line actually describes <em>ranges of seed numbers</em>.</p>
    <p>The values on the initial <code>seeds:</code> line come in pairs. Within each pair, the first value is the <em>start</em> of the range and the second value is the <em>length</em> of the range. So, in the first line of the example above:</p>
    <pre>seeds: 79 14 55 13</pre>
    <p>This line describes two ranges of seed numbers to be planted in the garden. The first range starts with seed number <code>79</code> and contains <code>14</code> values: <code>79</code>, <code>80</code>, ..., <code>91</code>, <code>92</code>. The second range starts with seed number <code>55</code> and contains <code>13</code> values: <code>55</code>, <code>56</code>, ..., <code>66</code>, <code>67</code>.</p>
    <p>Now, rather than considering four seed numbers, you need to consider a total of <em>27</em> seed numbers.</p>
    <p>In the above example, the lowest location number can be obtained from seed number <code>82</code>, which corresponds to soil <code>84</code>, fertilizer <code>84</code>, water <code>84</code>, light <code>77</code>, temperature <code>45</code>, humidity <code>46</code>, and <em>location <code>46</code></em>. So, the lowest location number is <code><em>46</em></code>.</p>
    <p>Consider all of the initial seed numbers listed in the ranges on the first line of the almanac. <em>What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?</em></p>
