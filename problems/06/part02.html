<article class="day-desc"><p>As the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record distances you got earlier actually just has <span title="Keming!">very bad</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning" target="_blank">kerning</a>. There's really <em>only one race</em> - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.</p>
<p>So, the example from before:</p>
<pre>Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
</pre>
<p>...now instead means this:</p>
<pre>Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
</pre>
<p>Now, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this example, the race lasts for <em>71530 milliseconds</em> and the record distance you need to beat is <em>940200 millimeters</em>. You could hold the button anywhere from 14 to 71516 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of <em>71503</em> ways!</p>
<p><em>How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?</em></p>
